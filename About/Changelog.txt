  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Configurable Maps" (originally "Fewer Ruins")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 03/19/2017
	- Initial release.

- 04/23/2017
	- The mod now uses the Harmony library instead of detouring core methods.

- 05/06/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld alpha 17.

- 05/25/2017
	- Config settings now allow customization of ruin and shrine density.

- 05/27/2017
	- The mod now also allows customization of ore and geyser density on new
	  maps.

- 06/03/2017
	- The mod's name has been changed from "Fewer Ruins" to "Configurable Maps,"
	  to reflect its expanding utility.
	- Added the ability to customize the "water level" on new maps, which will
	  affect the number and size of lakes, marshes, etc.

- 06/04/2017
	- Added "[RF]" prefix tag to the mod's name for easier mod list sorting.

- 06/10/2017
	- Added the ability to define whether ruins and shrines should be constructed
	  from random stone types (as in vanilla) or only from "local" stone types.

- 06/11/2017
	- River sizes, as well as lakes and marshes, are now affected by the "water
	  level" setting.
	- Added a new "ocean level on coastal maps" setting, which allows control of
	  the amount of water on maps with coasts, from vanilla-style maps with just
	  a small strip of water and sand on one edge, all the way to maps that are
	  almost fully submerged.

- 06/27/2017
	- Added a "biodensity" slider to adjust the density of animal and plant life
	  on maps (relative to the base values for the biome).
	- Each settings slider now includes a "random" option.
	- Larger rivers will now tend to have more deep water, with fewer fordable
	  spots. This is affected by the "water level" setting; rivers on maps with
	  high water levels will be less easily forded than those on maps with low
	  water levels.

- 07/29/2017
	- Split the settings into two separate configuration screens, one for terrain
	  options and one for "things" options, in order to allow more to fit.
	- Split the "biodensity" setting into two separate settings, one for animal
	  density and one for plant density.
	- Added a "mountain level" option that works similarly to the "water level"
	  option.

- 08/24/2017
	- The "mountain level" slider now produces much more obvious differences in
	  generated maps.
	- Added an option to alter the quantity of stone chunks scattered on maps.

- 09/16/2017
	- Added an option to disallow rock outcroppings in water. This will prevent
	  the appearance of odd solid rock "islands" in oceans, lakes and marshes.
	- Low water options now produce somewhat dryer maps than before.
	- Added a German language translation file courtesy of Ludeon forums user
	  Maculator.

- 09/17/2017
	- The impact of the "mountain level" slider is now dependent upon the type
	  of map being generated. It will have a significant impact on how mountain
	  maps look, but very little impact on how flat maps look. So setting the
	  mountain level to "very high" will no longer make every map look like a
	  mountain map.
	- Made some adjustments to ensure compatibility with my new "Archipelagos"
	  mod.

- 09/19/2017
	- Fixed a small glitch in the "Archipelagos" compatibility.

- 09/23/2017
	- Added a "soil fertility" slider to adjust the relative amount of rich
	  soil as opposed to basic soil on a map. (The slider does nothing on maps
	  for biomes that don't have any rich soil to begin with.)
	- Added the ability to designate the minimum and maximum number of stone
	  types that can appear in a world map tile.
	- Added the ability to designate the relative commonality of various stone
	  types on the world map.
	- Updated a few things to match today's "Archipelagos" update.

- 11/07/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- Fixed animal and plant density settings so they actually apply to 
	  archipelago maps as well as to vanilla biome maps.

- 11/12/2017
	- Added Japanese language translation file by Proxyer.

- 11/17/2017
	- Fixed river generation.

- 12/03/2017
	- Added Russian translation files by Steam user "Чей-то друг."

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 12/09/2017
	- It is now possible to define the total number of factions that should be
	  present on a world map, as well as to remove certain faction types or
	  adjust various faction types' relative abundance.
	- Tiles on the world map can now be set to have a maximum of eight different
	  stone types instead of just five, if for some reason you feel the need to
	  have that many different types of stone readily available.
	- This mod's settings for number and variety of stone types on world map
	  tiles should now take precedence over similar settings in other mods,
	  regardless of load order.

- 12/09/2017
	- Updated Japanese language files.

- 12/12/2017
	- Added the option to "group" faction bases on the world map geographically,
	  rather than just having them scattered all over the map randomly.
	- Added the ability to "turn off" the mechanoid faction, (mostly) removing
	  them from the game.

- 12/15/2017
	- Moved the faction-related settings into a separate mod, "Faction Control."

- 01/01/2018
	- Added an option to disallow "fake" ores (compacted steel, plasteel and
	  machinery) on maps.

- 01/01/2018
	- Updated Japanese language files.

- 01/20/2018
	- Fixed an incompatibility which prevented floors on "Biomes!" cavern maps
	  from using that mod's rocky soil instead of rough stone.
	- Corrected a typo. Ore now has a "low density" option instead of a "lore
	  density" option.

- 01/21/2018
	- If "Cupro's Stones" is in use, that mod's settings will now override this
	  mod's settings regarding number and types of stones in world map tiles.
